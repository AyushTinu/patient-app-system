# patient-app-system

## still a work in progress

first php project of a hospital/ clinic system

this is a simple PHP project where we can register any patient into a mysql server which then can be logged in by the user
the user then can anytime book an appointment with a particular doctor

there exist an admin pannel which controls all users doctors and could modify and delete the data created by the user
the admin can add/delete doctor, user, cinics etc.

later would like to implement some more features like
1. making an whats app bot which a user can interact
2. create an android app based on this system
